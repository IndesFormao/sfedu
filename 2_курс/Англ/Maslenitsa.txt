I'd like to tell you about a festival Maslenitsa. Maslenitsa is a Slavic festival celebrated in late February or early March. It lasts for a week and marks the end of winter and the beginning of spring.

Beautiful and warm clothes are worn during this festival because it is still cold. Women wear bright scarves and traditional dresses. Men often wear long shirts with belts. Children wear hats and warm coats when they play outside.

Maslenitsa has many fun traditions. People make and eat pancakes, which are a symbol of the Sun. There are outdoor games like sledding, snowball fights, and climbing poles. Bonfires are built, and people burn a straw doll to say goodbye to winter.

Many people like Maslenitsa because it is full of joy and fun. Families and friends come together to celebrate. It is a time to enjoy food, games, and welcome the warmer days of spring.
That's all.
