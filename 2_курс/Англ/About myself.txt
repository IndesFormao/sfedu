Hello! My name is Nikolay. I come from Donetsk. Now, now I live in Rostov-on-Don.
I am a student. I am not married. I don’t have children.
I have a small family. I have a mother, a father, and one sister.
I like to spend time with my friends. I don't have many, butI'm finewith them. We like to play games (videogames and table games) and watch movies together.
I am friendly and kind. I don’t like to help many people. I am also curious and like to learn new things.
I enjoy reading and listening to music. I am happy to meet new people!
