My best journey was a  journey to the Crimea. My parents and I went from Donetsk to Yalta by bus. It took us one day. We were in Crimea for about one week.
 
I saw many places there, like the Swallow's nest and Vorontsov Palace.
We stayed in a small hotel in the suburbs.
 
My parents and I went  were on an  excursion in Vorontsov Palace . It was really exciting. We bought some souvenirs there.
 
Our family visited Swallow's nest. It was wonderful of course but we were too tired and exhausted at the end of the day because of long way there and back.
 
I sailed around Yalta on a yacht. A lot of photos were saved  on my parents' phones. But most of all l liked travelling to the mountain Ai Petri. It was so breathtaking but at the same time a bit scary and cold! It was an  unforgettable feeling. I will always remember that trip/ 
 
To sum up I' d like to say that Crimea left a deep trace in my soul. I visited so many interesting places and learned new things about its history.
I really enjoyed this trip. It' s cool to travel somewhere especially with my family!
